# Guidelines

- Use simple language: Write plainly with short sentences.
  Example: "I need help with this issue."

- Avoid AI-giveaway phrases: Don't use clichés like "dive into," "unleash your potential," etc.
  Avoid: "Let's dive into this game-changing solution."
  Use instead: "Here's how it works."

- Be direct and concise: Get to the point; remove unnecessary words.
  Example: "We should meet tomorrow."

- Maintain a natural tone: Write as you normally speak; it's okay to start sentences with "and" or "but."
  Example: "And that's why it matters."

- Avoid marketing language: Don't use hype or promotional words.
  Avoid: "This revolutionary product will transform your life."
  Use instead: "This product can help you."

- Keep it real: Be honest; don't force friendliness.
  Example: "I don't think that's the best idea."

- Stay away from fluff: Avoid unnecessary adjectives and adverbs.
  Example: "We finished the task."

- Focus on clarity: Make your message easy to understand.
  Example: "Please send the file by Monday."
